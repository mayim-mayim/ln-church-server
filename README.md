# ln-church-server

Your API will be hit by autonomous agents.

Can it issue 402 challenges, accept settlement, verify execution, and produce evidence — across L402, x402, and MPP?

`ln-church-server` is a **provider-side starter** for building agent-facing paid APIs.  
It helps developers expose HTTP 402-compatible endpoints that autonomous agents can benchmark, pay, execute, and trace through the LN Church ecosystem.
It is the seller-side counterpart to `ln-church-agent`: while the agent decides how to pay, the server makes paid API surfaces explicit, inspectable, and verifiable.

## Core Doctrine

**Do not make agents spend tokens guessing how your paid API works.**

`ln-church-server` exists to turn provider-side paid actions into deterministic, inspectable, and verifiable HTTP 402 surfaces.

A provider should not expose a vague paywall that forces autonomous agents to guess:
- how payment is challenged,
- which rail is accepted,
- how settlement is verified,
- what action was executed,
- or what evidence proves success.

Instead, this starter structures the provider side as a clear machine-facing loop:

**Challenge → Settle → Execute → Verify → Emit Evidence**

---

## What it does

Most payment infrastructure helps providers charge.  
`ln-church-server` helps providers expose agent-facing paid-action endpoints that can participate in the whole **402 loop**:

**Challenge → Settle → Execute → Verify → Emit Evidence**

It is designed for providers that must:
- **Issue** HTTP 402 challenges formatted for autonomous agents.
- **Support** L402, x402, MPP, or compatible settlement paths.
- **Verify** settlement evidence before executing protected actions.
- **Return** receipts or verifiable responses after execution.
- **Expose** benchmarkable endpoints for client interoperability testing.
- **Connect** to LN Church Sandbox / observability flows for public proof.

## Where it fits

`ln-church-server` is the provider-side counterpart to `ln-church-agent`.

Together, they reduce the reasoning burden of autonomous agents around paid API execution:

| Component | Role | Core responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ln-church-agent` | Buyer-side runtime | Decide whether and how an agent should pay, execute, and verify an HTTP 402 flow |
| `ln-church-server` | Provider-side runtime | Expose paid API capabilities as agent-readable surfaces with challenge, execution, and evidence metadata |
| LN Church Sandbox | Observability layer | Collect benchmark, receipt, trace, and interop evidence from both sides |

In short:

- `ln-church-agent` prevents agents from spending tokens figuring out how to pay.
- `ln-church-server` prevents agents from spending tokens guessing how a paid API works.
- LN Church Sandbox makes the resulting behavior observable and comparable.

## Agent-Readable Paid Surfaces

As of v1.7.0, `ln-church-server` can expose provider capabilities as **agent-readable paid surfaces**.

A paid surface is not just a paywall. It is a machine-readable contract that tells agents:

- what endpoint is being sold,
- which assets and settlement paths are accepted,
- what behavior the client should take,
- what schema the challenge body follows,
- and what execution evidence will be returned after payment.

Unpaid requests can return:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "ln_church.paid_surface_challenge.v1",
  "surface": {
    "surface_id": "skill:json-repair:v1",
    "resource": "/api/agent/json-repair",
    "action_type": "json_repair",
    "payment_intent": "charge"
  },
  "accepted_payments": [
    {
      "asset": "SATS",
      "amount": 50,
      "settlement_rail": "l402",
      "access_path": "direct_settlement"
    },
    {
      "asset": "GRANT_CREDIT",
      "amount": 2,
      "settlement_rail": "none",
      "access_path": "sponsored_grant"
    }
  ],
  "expected_client_behavior": {
    "action": "pay_and_verify"
  }
}
```

Paid requests can return:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": "...",
  "execution_receipt": {
    "schema_version": "ln_church.execution_receipt.v1",
    "surface_id": "skill:json-repair:v1",
    "payment_status": "succeeded",
    "execution_status": "completed",
    "verification_status": "verified"
  }
}
```

This lets agents avoid spending reasoning tokens on payment mechanics and instead delegate repetitive interpretation to their runtime.

## 🧠 Why this is not just a paywall template

To participate in the agentic economy, a provider must prove its API is reliable *before* agents commit funds to expensive computational tasks. This server is structured specifically for that purpose.

* **Deterministic Benchmark Surface**: Provides built-in, predictable endpoints strictly for AI agents to test protocol compliance.
* **Buyer-Side Runtime Validation**: Allows agents to verify replay protection, receipt generation, and signature integrity against your server.
* **Benchmark First, Skill Second**: Architecture physically separates the benchmark validation layer from your actual computational skills.
* **Unified Execution Surface**: Handles both direct HTTP 402 settlement and trusted grant overrides through the same execution pipeline.

## ⚡ Start in 5 Minutes

Deploying this starter provides a deterministic benchmark surface that buyer-side AI agents can use to validate your provider runtime.

### 1. Install & Run Locally
```bash
cd examples/hono-app
npm install

# Set up local secrets (.dev.vars)
echo "FAUCET_SECRET=your-secret" > .dev.vars
echo "MACAROON_SECRET=your-secret" >> .dev.vars

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Benchmark Surface
AI agents can immediately hit your benchmark endpoints to verify the 402 handshake and payload integrity.

```bash
# 1. Ping test (Validates connectivity & 402 handshake)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8787/api/agent/benchmark/ping

# 2. Echo test (Validates POST payload integrity & retry logic)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/agent/benchmark/echo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello agentic web"}'
```
*Both endpoints will return an HTTP 402 Payment Required challenge. Once paid via a compatible client, they return deterministic validation data.*

## 🤖 Reference Benchmark Suite

These endpoints are the core of **Public Evaluability**. They exist purely for machine-facing runtime interop testing.

* **`GET /api/agent/benchmark/ping`**
  * **Role**: Minimal paid GET for connectivity and 402 HTTP header handshake testing.
  * **Price**: 10 SATS / 1 Faucet Credit
* **`POST /api/agent/benchmark/echo`**
  * **Role**: Validates POST payload integrity and 402-retry behavior. Reflects the input text alongside execution metadata.
  * **Price**: 10 SATS / 1 Faucet Credit
* **`GET /api/agent/benchmark/replay/{corpus_id}`**
  * **Role**: Returns a synthetic replay descriptor derived from LN Church Interop Corpus.
  * **Purpose**: Lets agents validate whether their parser and behavior selection match previously observed protocol shapes.
  * **Replay Type**: `synthetic_from_corpus_v1`.
* **`GET /api/agent/benchmark/replay/{corpus_id}/challenge`**
  * **Role**: Emits a synthetic 402 challenge generated from corpus metadata.
  * **Expected behaviors**: `pay_and_verify`, `observe_only`, `stop_safely`, or `reject_invalid`.

### Synthetic Corpus Replay

The server can expose LN Church Interop Corpus items as synthetic benchmark replays.

This allows buyer-side agents to validate whether their parser and decision engine handle previously observed protocol shapes correctly.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/agent/benchmark/replay/{corpus_id}`
  - Returns a replay descriptor derived from an Interop Corpus item.
- `GET /api/agent/benchmark/replay/{corpus_id}/challenge`
  - Returns a synthetic 402 challenge generated from corpus metadata.

**Important:**
This is not raw wire-level replay.  
The replay type is `synthetic_from_corpus_v1`.  
It is designed for parser and behavior validation, not real settlement execution.

## 🛠️ Built-in Paid Surface Catalog

The starter includes four agent-readable paid surfaces:

| Surface ID | Endpoint | Type | Deterministic | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `benchmark:ping:v1` | `GET /api/agent/benchmark/ping` | benchmark | yes | Minimal 402 handshake and receipt validation |
| `skill:json-repair:v1` | `POST /api/agent/json-repair` | skill | yes | Repair malformed JSON into machine-readable output |
| `skill:compressor:v1` | `POST /api/agent/compressor` | skill | yes | Compress text for downstream agent processing |
| `skill:omikuji:v1` | `POST /api/agent/omikuji` | skill | no | Return a randomized paid result |

Agents can discover these surfaces from:

```bash
GET /api/agent/manifest
```

The manifest includes `paid_surfaces`, accepted payment options, expected client behavior, and receipt schema metadata.

## Paid Surface Diagnostics

`ln-church-server` can query LN Church Observatory for public-safe observations about your own paid surfaces.

This lets site operators check whether agents have observed payment frictions such as:
- retry mismatch
- no matching payment requirements
- post-settlement proof required
- receipt verification failure

**Important Safety Constraints:**
- These records are **not verdicts** about endpoint correctness. They are observed client/runtime conditions.
- `ln-church-server` does not automatically poll, send telemetry, or ingest direct feedback from agents.
- The LN Church Observatory is a public ledger, and this SDK provides a strictly **read-only** helper to query it on demand.

**Helper Usage:**
```ts
import { ShrineClient } from "@ln-church/hono";

const shrine = new ShrineClient("https://kari.mayim-mayim.com", "example.com");

const result = await shrine.fetchFailureObservations({
  targetDomain: "example.com",
  limit: 20
});

```

**Diagnostic Route Example:**
If you have mounted the built-in system routes (`/api/agent/*`), you can run a diagnostic check manually:

```bash
curl "https://your-node.example/api/agent/observations?domain=example.com"
```

## 💳 Payment Paths

This server supports two distinct access models through a single, unified execution surface.

### 1. Direct HTTP 402 Settlement (Canonical Path)
The primary machine-to-machine payment path for direct settlement.
* **Supported Protocols**: `x402` (EVM), `L402` (Lightning), `MPP` (Machine Payment Protocol draft).
* **Behavior**: Rejects unauthorized requests with `402 Payment Required`, validates incoming cryptographic proofs, and stores receipts via Cloudflare KV for strict replay protection.

### 2. Sponsored Grant Override (Onboarding Layer)
An experimental pre-payment access path for sponsor-funded execution.
* **Role**: This is **not** a replacement for direct 402 settlement, nor is it a settlement rail. It is an onboarding/distribution layer allowing agents to execute tasks by presenting a trusted, single-use grant token (JWS) before utilizing direct settlement.
* **Validation**: Strictly verifies issuer trust, audience, route/method scope, canonical agent ID binding, and payload semantics (e.g., `jti`, `GRANT_CREDIT`).

---

## 🌍 Where this fits in the ecosystem

* **Buyer-Side Runtime**: [`ln-church-agent`](https://github.com/mayim-mayim/ln-church-agent) (The Python SDK agents use to navigate 402 paywalls).
* **Provider-Side Starter**: `ln-church-server` (This repository, providing the benchmark surface).
* **Public Discovery / Sandbox**: **LN Church** (The public Agentic Payment Sandbox that can index, verify, and benchmark participating nodes running this provider stack).

*Note: Joining the public LN Church discovery network (`/api/agent/network/join`) is entirely optional. Your server operates as a fully autonomous benchmark node by default.*

### Standard-ready adapter boundary

`PaidSurfaceRequirement` is an internal provider-side descriptor, not a competing standard. 
As external payment and commerce protocols evolve, `ln-church-server` can map the same internal route definitions into future external profiles through mapper boundaries while keeping existing clients backward compatible.

---

## 🛡️ Security: Replay Protection

This kit includes an edge-native `ReceiptStore` implementation backed by **Cloudflare KV**. Every payment receipt is cryptographically checked and stored to prevent double-spending and replay attacks, ensuring your computational resources are never consumed for free.
